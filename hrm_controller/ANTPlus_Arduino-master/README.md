An Ant+ library for Arduino over UART ('Serial' or SoftwareSerial)

Provides message send and receive functionality
Also provides stringisers for a few messages
Provides higher-level functionality for setting up listening channels for a sensor

This works with a Nordic nRF24AP2 (should work with AP1 also)

Tested with this nRF24AP2 module : http://www.goodluckbuy.com/nrf24ap2-networking-module-zigbee-module-with-ant-transceiver-.html
